# ECE 143 Final Project

## File Structure
There are .py files for each “question” that we wished to answer with the CAPE dataset. Each .py file manipulates the data in ways that show interesting information, such as which class is considered the “best” overall and is there is a correlation between grade received and professor recommendation, Is it easier to take a course in summer, How are the enrollment trends in the ECE department? etc. All of our visualizations are combined in the Jupyter notebook "Cape_Analysis.ipynb". Our final presentation is saved as a .pdf file.

## How to Run Code
The .py files can be ran in a terminal with the command “python3.7 <file>” where <file> is the .py file that you wish to run. The file can also be ran in the Python shell by using “import <file>”. Then type “<file>” to run the script. However since all the functions are linked and its easy to run them in the Jupyter Notebook. The Juptyer notebook can be ran in the Jupyter environment.

## Third-Party Modules
We used Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to manipulate and represent our data.
